# **PROJECT _printf**

## BACKGROUND :atom:
This is a colaboration project between two sfotware development students at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) from Cohort 12, This project is about to create our own printf function call _printf()

## _printf()
Function to produce output ro stdout according to a format.

### Formats 
%Characters | Description
----------- | -------------
**%i** | Print a variable type *integer*.
**%c** | Print a variable type *char*.
**%d** | Print a variable type *decimal*.
**%s** | Print a variable type *string*.

### Files
This list is our files used to integrate the all function _printf

* [holberton](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/holberton.h)
Header of the _pritnf function where are store the prototypes and libraries

* [_putchar](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/_putchar.c)
Function writes a variable type c to standard out.

* [Function_int](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/function_int.c)
Function prints and return a variable type integer and decimal to standard out.

* [Function_char](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/function_char.c)
Function prints and return a variable type character to standard out

* [Function_str](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/function_str.c)
Function prints and return a variable type string to standard out.

* [_printf](https://github.com/Villasdaniel/printf/blob/master/_printf.c)
Function to produces output to stdout according to a previous format.

#### REQUIREMENTS

* Allowed editors: *vi*, *vim*, *emacs*
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with *gcc 4.8.4* using the flags *-Wall -Werror -Wextra* and *-pedantic*
* All your files should end with a new line
* A *README.md* file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the *Betty* style. It will be checked using *betty-style.pl* and *betty-doc.pl*
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the *main.c* files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own *main.c* files at compilation. Our *main.c* files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called *holberton.h*
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Note that we will not provide the *_putchar* function for this project
